# ANDRITZ Dev Assessment

This is a evaluation test for developer position.

There are 2 tests:

1: Imagine that we have a subtitle file (.srt) out of sync. The program must be able to shift the whole source file by the given timespan.
This code adjusts the times in subtitles of an SRT (SubRip) format file. It shifts the subtitle times according to a given time interval.
The path of the SRT files was changed to perform the test, you may need to change them.


2: Given a predefined list of links, the program must be able to calculate the possible paths between one point and another.
The code provides an implementation of a weighted directed graph (a set of vertices and edges with associated weights). 
It also includes an implementation of the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all paths between two specific vertices in the graph.
